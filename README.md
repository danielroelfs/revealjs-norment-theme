# NORMENT reveal.js theme

Repository to host the reveal.js theme for NORMENT purposes. So far this is just a showcase, but in time perhaps it'll turn into a template.

The reveal.js framework is added as a submodule in the reveal.js directory. You can find installation files (`package.json`) and instructions for installing reveal.js there.
